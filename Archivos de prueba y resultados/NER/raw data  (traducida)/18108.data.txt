Dictation 9292






1.- By means of a background report, a Superintendent has been addressed to a worker requesting a ruling on what was resolved by COMPIN through Exempt Resolution of 2015, in which the claim against ISAPRE was rejected, for the calculation of the subsidy for Disability due to medical leave.
2.- On this matter, this Superintendency informs that the calculation made by ISAPRE to determine the subsidies corresponding to the licenses was reviewed, and it was found that both were poorly determined.
In fact, for the calculation of the subsidy of the license granted from February 3, 2015, the taxable remuneration for the months of November and December of 2014 and January of 2015 was considered, however, for the month of November The taxable remuneration was not considered, which is registered in the certificate of impositions of the AFP.
Regarding the subsidy for the license granted on May 15, 2015, the salaries of February, March and April 2015 should have been included, but in February, ISAPRE did not consider the remuneration received by the interested party as " Special bonus ", as it is considered occasional. It should be noted that according to the antecedents that were in sight, such as salary settlements for six months of 2015, the aforementioned remuneration was received at least three times in a row, so it is not occasional.
3.- In consideration of the above, this Superintendence accepts the claim of the interested party and instructs COMPIN to order ISAPRE to re-examine the subsidies claimed by the interested party, incorporating the observations made and paying the corresponding differences.
