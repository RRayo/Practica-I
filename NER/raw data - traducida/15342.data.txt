N ° XXXXX (Q.E.P.D.) on January 10, 2005-, because it is not in agreement with the amount received, since it would not be enough to cover the various basic expenses to survive, although it has no children to support.

2.- That Mutuality required in this respect, has informed in detail about the procedure and calculation used and made to determine the aforementioned widow's pension and its initial value, accompanying the corresponding supporting documentation.

3.- On this matter, this Agency must express that it has analyzed the case file, being able to verify that, in accordance with the antecedents that have been in sight, both the procedure used and the calculation made by that Entity to determine the Benefit to which the appellant was entitled, would be incorrect, for the objections that will be formulated later.

Although that Institute correctly calculated the pension which would have been payable to the deceased if it had been totally invalidated, it made errors in the appraisal of the appellant's widow's pension, although they do not affect the final value to be paid The beneficiary, implies procedural flaws that could be repeated in other cases in which the errors do affect pensioners.

In this regard, it is possible to specify the following:

By Resolution No. SP-06-2005, of July 18, 2005, that Mutuality granted Mrs. XXXX a widow's pension of Law No. 16,744, as surviving spouse of Mr. NN, as a result of the Accident of work that occurred to him on January 10, 2005, for an initial amount of $ 77,076.54 per month, starting precisely from this last date.

In order to determine the monthly base salary of this benefit, as set forth in the first paragraph of Article 26 and Article 44 of Law No. 16,744, the taxable remuneration received by the deceased was considered in the six months immediately preceding the Date of the accident at work (January 2005), corresponding in this case to the period from July to December 2004. These remunerations were deflated according to article 4 of the DL. No. 3,501, of 1980, that is to say, they were divided by the factor 1,1757 corresponding to the workers affiliated to the New Pension System, and then they were amplified according to the provisions of the fifth clause of the indicated article 26 of Law N 16.744, that is to say, according to the variation experienced by the vital salary, now referred to the minimum income for non-remuneration purposes, from the date they were received up to the date from which the right to the pension was established , Generating a monthly base salary of $ 143,089, of which 70% reached $ 100,162.

However, having reviewed the respective Spreadsheet, it has been verified that this Institute did not comply with the provisions of article 1 of Law No. 19,953, in the sense that as of September 1, 2004, the amount Of widows' pensions where there are no children of the deceased, orthopedic pension holders, among others, those governed by Law No. 16,744, may not be less than 55% of the pension of the deceased or of which he would have been entitled to receive, But applied only 50%. Therefore, in this case, the initial widow's pension calculation had to reach $ 55,089 per month, as of January 10, 2005, and not the $ 50,081 per month determined by that Mutuality. However, the calculation of a widow's pension of $ 55,089 per month, which was greater than the value of a minimum widowhood pension without children of pensioners under 70 years of age at the aforementioned date ($ 50,017.65 per month), should have been increased with the Bonuses set forth in Laws Nos. 19,403 and 19,539, so that the sum of the widow's pension and the bonuses reached the amount of a minimum pension of old age or invalidity of article 26 of Law No. 15,386, which as of January 10, 2005 was $ 77,076.54 Monthly.

Finally, it is pertinent to remind the Bank of what is established in the second paragraph of the aforementioned Article 1 of Law No. 19,953, in the sense that, as from September 1, 2005, the amount of pensions such as the one Analysis, can not be less than 60% of the pension of the deceased or that would have corresponded to him to perceive.
4.- On merit of the above, together with declaring that this Mutuality does not owe any amount to the appellant, since the total received by this is equivalent to the sum of the pension that should have received plus the corresponding bonuses, understanding with it The Superintendency instructs that Institute to take the necessary measures to apply the procedure defined in this opportunity to similar cases that may arise in the future
