Dictamen 2708






The resolution was approved by the National Caja de Empleados Públicos y Periodistas (National Caja de Empleados Públicos y Periodistas), which by virtue of letter c) of article 16 of Law No. 10,475 denied the right to an orphan's pension to the appellant for being over 18 years of age and not following Secondary, university or special education, at the date of death of the offender.
The above conclusion supports the verbal form used by the aforementioned legal provision, which states that the children to whom it refers must accredit "truthfully" to be students, etc. The present time used by the legislator clearly expresses the idea that these requirements must coexist with the fact that gives rise to the pension, which is, in this case, the death of the imposing mother, at which point it becomes enforceable.
It is noted that the fact of starting a university course after the death of the deceased does not alter the previous conclusion.
