Dictamen 226






Article 4, of D.F.L. No. 44, 1978, of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, establishes a period of three months of contributions in the last months of affiliation, to be entitled to the subsidy for incapacity for work.

In the opinion of this Superintendency, Article 4, of said D.F.L. No. 44, is limited to establishing a certain period of qualification that, in short, constitutes an enabling qualification to be entitled to enjoy the disability benefit.

For this reason, being the object of the norm in analysis, to refer the period of qualification to calendar months implies to distort the purpose that was had in establishing it and, in addition, would have as an immediate consequence to limit the enjoyment of a benefit that has been conceived by The legislator in general and broad terms.

On the other hand, it should be noted that when the aforementioned D.F.L. No. 44, intended to refer to calendar months, did so expressly, as it happens with the rule contained in Article 8 and that only relates to the determination of the amount of the subsidy, a matter that, as can easily be appreciated, differs substantially from The one that regulates the referred article 4.

Accordingly, this Agency complies with the statement that it is consistent with the conclusion reached by the Clearinghouse in order that the period of contributions required by Article 4 of the D.F.L. Nº 44, to enjoy the subsidy for incapacity for work must be understood to refer to 90 days of the period of affiliation that indicates.
